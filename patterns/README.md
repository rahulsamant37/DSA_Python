## How to Use

Each pattern directory contains focused function files that include:

1. **Single Function Focus**: Each file demonstrates one core concept clearly
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanations with complexity analysis  
3. **Practical Examples**: Real-world usage demonstrations
4. **Step-by-step Implementation**: Easy to understand code structure
5. **Educational Comments**: Learn the "why" behind each step

### Running Individual Functions

```bash
# Run any function file to see examples
python patterns/001_two_pointers/two_sum.py
python patterns/002_sliding_window/max_sum_subarray.py
python patterns/003_fast_slow_pointers/cycle_detection.py
python patterns/009_binary_search/search_sorted.py
# ... and so on
```

### Study Approach

1. **Start with basics**: Begin with Two Pointers and Sliding Window patterns
2. **One function at a time**: Focus on understanding individual implementations
3. **Run the examples**: Execute each file to see how the algorithms work
4. **Understand the pattern**: Learn when to apply each technique
5. **Expand gradually**: Add more functions to existing pattern directories
6. **Practice variations**: Implement similar problems using the same pattern

## Current Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**: Each pattern (001-012) has at least one focused function implementation  
ðŸ”„ **Expandable**: You can add more function files to any pattern directory  
ðŸ“š **Educational**: Each file is designed for learning and understanding  

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Choose a pattern** you want to learn
2. **Navigate to its directory** (e.g., `001_two_pointers/`)

## Contributing

Feel free to add more function files to existing pattern directories or suggest new patterns that are commonly used in coding interviews.

### Adding New Functions

To add a new function to any pattern:

1. **Create a new .py file** in the appropriate pattern directory
2. **Focus on one function** per file for clarity
3. **Include comprehensive documentation** with complexity analysis
4. **Add practical examples** showing how the function works
5. **Follow the established naming convention** (descriptive_name.py)

Example structure for new functions:
```python
"""
Pattern Name - Function Purpose
===============================

Brief description of what the function does.

Time Complexity: O(?)
Space Complexity: O(?)
"""

def your_function(parameters):
    """
    Detailed function documentation.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description
        param2: Description
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

def example_usage():
    """Demonstrate the function"""
    # Example code here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
