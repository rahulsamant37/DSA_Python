# Collections Module for DSA

This directory contains organized examples of Python's `collections` module utilities that are particularly useful for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## Structure

Each subfolder represents one specific utility or class from the collections module:

- **Counter/** - Examples of Counter class for counting hashable objects
- **deque/** - Examples of deque (double-ended queue) operations
- **defaultdict/** - Examples of defaultdict for dictionaries with default values
- **OrderedDict/** - Examples of OrderedDict for maintaining insertion order
- **heapq/** - Examples of heapq module for heap operations
- **ChainMap/** - Examples of ChainMap for combining multiple dictionaries
- **namedtuple/** - Examples of namedtuple for creating named tuple subclasses

## Learning Approach

Each subfolder contains multiple Python files, where **each file demonstrates exactly one functionality or method** related to that class or module. This approach allows for:

1. Focused learning of individual concepts
2. Easy reference for specific functionality
3. Modular understanding of each utility
4. Practical DSA applications

## Usage in DSA

These collections are commonly used in competitive programming and algorithm implementation because they provide:

- Efficient data structures
- Built-in optimized operations
- Cleaner, more readable code
- Better time and space complexity for specific use cases
